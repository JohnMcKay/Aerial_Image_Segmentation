# Aerial_Image_Segmentation
Like the road image classification project, I  used Google Colab to develop a simple segmentation model for labeled aerial imagery. It boiled down to simple "mini" unets and trying out soft IoU loss. This might be helpful for someone who wants to see a straightforward tensorflow-based keras model for segmentation.
